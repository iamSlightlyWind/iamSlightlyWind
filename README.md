- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iamSlightlyWind.
- Self-taught, currently working on TMO's AI and IoT devices.
 
`Development: C; C++; Java;`
 
`Front-end: HTML; CSS;`

`Back-end: JS; Java;`

- `iamSlightlyWind/*` are just some private bigass repos I kept for all sorts of things I develop on my own, and also temporary practice files.
- If you see me active with DRP mentioning hidden repos, then there might not be anything that will interest you here, at least not for now.
